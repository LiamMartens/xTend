#Introducing xTend

###What is xTend?
xTend is a PHP MVC framework. While other frameworks, such as Laravel, are focusing on implementing every feature or function a developer could ever want, xTend is focused on keeping it fast, adaptable, extendable and non-bloated. This means there is a lot of built-in features you'll find in Laravel you will not find here, however because of the adaptable and extendable nature of xTend it is extremely easy to add a library, or your own script, to enable a certain feature.

###What's in it for me?
* Dependency free
* Simple packagist support
* Clean and powerful URL's
* Easy to understand structure (Model-View-Controller)
* Easy to setup and configure
* Easy to adapt and extend
* Blazing fast
* Easily customizable templating engine
* A lot of helper functions to keep your code clean
* A simple CLI to do basic interactions

*Notice I ran some benchmarks using the `ab -c 10 -t 3` command and I average at around 650 rps on Lighttpd with PHP-CGI*

###Example
You can find an example application in the `examples` directory. It's a very simple tasklist project. (Don't forget to set the app url when you run it)
