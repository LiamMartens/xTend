##Creating views

To create a view you just need to create a file in the `\System\Views` directory. You can opt for a normal view, which would just be a `.php` file but you can also create a `.wow.php` file which would be compiled using the WOW templating engine.

To read more about the WOW temlate you can read section [11.a Using WOW templates](/0.7.x/11.a%20Using%20WOW%20templates)  

To read more about the `View` object, the PHP object which is created for every initialized view file, you can read [11.b Using and customizing the View object](11.b%20Using%20and%20customizing%20the%20View%20object)
