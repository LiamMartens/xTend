##Route URL's

###Simple URL
The simplest URL option is hardcoding it. For example if you use `$router->any('foo/bar', {route})`
then the url `foo/bar` will be matched.

###URL variable
You can also use URL variables like this: `$router->any('user/{id}', {route})`. This will get the value of the URL variable and put it into the UrlHelper. You can access the variable using `$app->getUrlHandler()->$id` or `$app->getUrlHandler()->getData('id')`.

###Regex
You can specify some rules using a regex for a url part like this: `$router->any('user/rx{your-regex}')`. This will match the second part of the url using your regular expression. (Besides regex you can also just put a `*` to match anything like a wildcard)

###Regexed URL variable
You can combine a regex with a variable to make sure you're not getting any faul data into your application. The syntax is as follows: `$router->any('user/rx{id}{your-regex}')`.

###Multi URL
You can add `|` to your URL handle to match multiple handles. For example `$router->any('foo|bar', {route})` will match both the url `foo` and `bar.
