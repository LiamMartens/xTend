#xTend 0.7.0
##Giving your app a namespace

If you have already taken a look inside the `\www\index.php` file you will have noticed the namespace is `xTend\Application` and not just `xTend` like in all the other classes. The reason for this is the ability to be able to run multiple instances of `App` with the ability to retrieve the current `App` anywhere. You can set this namespace to anything you find suitable for your current project or leave as is but remember to change the namespace in the config files as well. More about this in the next chapter.
