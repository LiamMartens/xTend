##Understanding the app launch sequence

It is important for further parts of the documentation to understand in what order the xTend app is loaded. The sequence is as follows:  

1. The App is instantiated as an object and stored in the `global $apps` array.  

2. All the `\System\Core` files, `\System\Objects` and `\System\Blueprints` necessary to run the app are loaded.  

3. A backup is created if the interval is exceeded.  

4. A secure session is started.  

5. The cookie encryption key is generated.  

6. The library files are loaded.  

7. The pre configuration methods are launched.  

8. The configuration files are included.  

9. The post configuration methods are launched.  

10. Routes are executed if bootstrap mode is off.
