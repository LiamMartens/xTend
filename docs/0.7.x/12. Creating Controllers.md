##Creating Controllers

To make a controller for your project you need to create a file inside the `\System\Controllers` directory. Make sure you give the same name to your controller class and your file (excluding the `.php` extension). By default you might want to put your controller class inside the `namespace xTend`, but you don't have to. It is just as good to specify your own namespace.  

Keep in mind you can always take a look at the controller blueprints, or even `extend` them, to make sense of what default methods you could include. Just as with the view, the controller can take data with the appropriate data methods. (do keep in mind that if the controller gets data, the view won't get it as you should only have 1 instance with data or else you might be changing data where you don't want it to).
