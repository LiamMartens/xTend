##Using and customizing the View object

Whenever a view is initialized by the `Router` (you'll read more about creating routes further down the documentation) an object of type `View` is created. You can see the code for this object in the `\System\Objects\View.php` file. The object will store several things such as the name of the view, it's path, it'll check whether it's WOW enabled or not and so on. However, you can define a custom `View` object if you'd like to step away from the default object. (creating a custom view will require you to use a more advanced way of creating routes, which we won't go over right now, so keep that in mind).  

###Requirements
A view object doesn't really have any requirements by default. It is important to keep in mind you'll get the current `app` and the name of the view as parameters in the constructor and it is also important that if you want to accept view data you'll have to `extend` the `BaseDataExtension` class or you can implement the necessary methods yourself. (`getData`, `setData`, `inData`) Alternatively you can also `extend` the `BaseDataView` class which also has this functionality.
