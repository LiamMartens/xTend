#xTend 0.7.0
##Including Libs

Including third-party libraries is as easy as adding the files in the `\System\Libs` directory. xTend will automatically include all the files inside this folder, though you can intervene a bit here using the files `.order`, `.exclude` and `.ignore`.

###.order
To change the order of the file inclusion you can create a `.order` file in the directory where you want to change the order of files. All files specified in this file will be loaded first. Here is an example of an order file:
```
file05.php
file03.php
file01.php
```
Let's say there are 5 files in the directory where `.order` resides, `file01.php`, `file02.php`, ... up until `file05.php`. The order file will tell xTend to load files 05,03 and 01 first in that order and afterwards continue with the rest of the files in the directory.

###.exclude
You can add this file to a directory to completely ignore it. This can come in handy if the library you're adding has it's own file loader in a different file.

###.ignore
This last file will tell xTend to ignore certain files. Just like the order file you'll specify 1 file on each line and every file defined in here will be ignored by xTend.
