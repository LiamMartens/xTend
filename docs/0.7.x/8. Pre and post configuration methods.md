##Pre and post configuration methods

xTend makes use of pre and post configuration methods to launch additional functions if necessary. You can add these yourself by using the `addPreConfigurationMethod` and the `addPostConfigurationMethod` functions. If you have read the previous section you'll know exactly when your methods will be launched. Below are some examples.

###Preconfiguration method
This is an example of a registering a pre configuration method.
```
    $app->addPreConfigurationMethod(function($app) {
        var_dump($app);
    });
```
As you can see in this example the registered function accepts one parameter called `$app` in this case. When an xTend app calls the pre configuration methods it will automatically pass itself to the method so the app object can be used in the function. You don't have to accept this parameter but it's there if you need it.

##Postconfiguration method
This is an example of registering a post configuration method.
```
    $app->addPostConfigurationMethod(function($app) {
        var_dump($app);
    });
```
The post configuration method acts the same way as the pre configuration one and thus the app object is also automatically passed into the function for it to be used. Again you can ignore this parameter altogether if you want.
