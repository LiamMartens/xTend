##More on the ErrorCodeHandler
To access your application's `ErrorCodeHandler` you can call the `getErrorCodeHandler()` method in your application. With the handler you can register new errors and find already registered ones.

###Registering new ones
To register a new error code you can use the `registerErrorCode` method. You can supply the method with a maximum of 3 parameters, the error code, the error name and an optional readable name. Here is an example: 
```
	$app->getErrorCodeHandler()->registerErrorCode(404, "http:404", "Page Not Found");
```

###Finding registered errors
You can also get registered errors by using the `findError` method supplied with an error code or an error name. (You can also put in the hex code equivalent of the error code, for 404 this is 0x0194 to give an example. In the logs error codes are written with their hex equivalent)
```
	$app->getErrorCodeHandler()->findError(0x194);
```

###Throwing an error
To throw an error you can use the `throwError` method in your app instance. Just supply an errorcode or name and the error will be logged in and the application will look for an error page to load.
```
	$app->throwError("http:404");
```
