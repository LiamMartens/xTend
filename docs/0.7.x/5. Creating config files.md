##Creating config files

Creating a config file isn't as simple as just making a new file in the respective directory and you're done. After making the file you'll have to add following code if you need to access your application:
```
<?php
    namespace {your namespace}
    {
        $app=\xTend\getCurrentApp(__NAMESPACE__);
    }
```

This code will set your config file up in the namespace you have chosen at the beginning of running your application and the method `getCurrentApp` will retrieve your current application based on the namespace. Do make sure you are not trying to configure the wrong application. When the application is not found using the provided namespace it'll return `false`. Check for `false` before executing configuration code when running multiple instances. Also check the 3 config files which are in place by default.
