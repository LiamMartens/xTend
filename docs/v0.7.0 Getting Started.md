#This is the documentation for the 0.7.0 release of xTend.
##The old documentation will disappear from Read The Docs somewhere at the start of 2016 as the 0.7.0 release will be the new and updated version of xTend as this is a complete rewrite from scratch. Upgrading from xTend 0.6.x will be detailed in a different guide later on.
