#SASS Compiler
The documentation of the compiler itself can be found here [PHP SCSS](http://leafo.net/scssphp/)
##Compiling SASS
For performance the SASS is not compiled by default. If you are working on SASS files and want it to compile you have to set `Development` to `true` inside the `/System/Config/Core.php` file. If it is set to `false` the SASS files will not compile.
##Configuration
The configuration file for the compiler can be found inside `/System/Config`
