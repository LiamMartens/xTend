#xTend 0.8.x
###What is xTend?
xTend is a PHP MVC framework. While other frameworks, such as Laravel, are focusing on implementing every feature or function a developer could ever want, xTend is focused on keeping it fast, adatable, extendable and non-bloated. This means there is a lot of built-in features you'll find in Laravel you will not find here, though because of the adaptable and extendable nature of xTend it is extremely easy to add a library, or your own script, to enable a certain feature.

###What's in it for me?
* Clean and powerful URL's
* Easy to understand structure (Model-View-Controller)
* Easy to setup and configure
* Easy to adapt and extend
* Blazing fast
* Easily customizable templating engine
* A lot of helper functions to keep your code clean
* A simple CLI to do basic interactions
