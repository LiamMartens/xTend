    "description": "xTend is a PHP MVC framework. While other frameworks, such as Laravel, are focusing on implementing every feature or function a developer could ever want, xTend is focused on keeping it fast, adatable, extendable and non-bloated. This means there is a lot of built-in features you'll find in Laravel you will not find here, though because of the adaptable and extendable nature of xTend it is extremely easy to add a library, or your own script, to enable a certain feature.",
